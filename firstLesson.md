# JavaScrip y NodeJS
##First Steps

Once we already install node JS, we can start a simple program, but before we ned to make sure that we have install correctly node JS
To do that in our terminal we have to type de next command:

```sh
node --version
```
Now you could see in your terminal the version of NodeJS like this:

```sh
v10.19.0
```
Let's start writting our first code, to do this we need to create a file, you can name it with you favorite name, in this case I'll name it HelloEveryone.
At the moment that we want to create a fille we should verify that the extension of our file is (.jS) that means that is a JavaScrip file.

We'll create the file using the next command:

```sh
touch HelloEveryone.js
```
Notice that inside of our directory we can find the previous file, How to verify that que create the file? Well let's type the next command in out bash

```sh
ls
```
We'll see the file and directories inside of our main directory

We can use your favorite code editor, for this ocation we'll use vim and SublimeText, remenber use your the tool that you feel more confortable

```sh
vim HelloEveryone.js
```
 Inside we'll print the next message:

```sh
console.log("Hello Everyone I'll become an amazing developer! :D")
```
Now It's time to prove our firts code, to execute the previous code we use node:

```sh
node HelloEveryone.js 
```

You will see an output in your bash something like this:

```sh
Hello Everyone I'll become an amazing developer! :D
```

Congratulations!! You write your first program, In the next lesson we'll learn other interesthing topics and commands
